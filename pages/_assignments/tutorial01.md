In today's tutorial, we will examine how platforms and ad networks store, analyze and act on the data they collect about their users, and specifically how this works on a Web Browser. To do this, we will first define some technical concepts and terms (e.g., HTTP requests, cookies, and third-party cookies, etc.), and then do two short activities.
